# Get_Next_Line
In this project at UNIT Factory (School 42) I must have created function 

that that returns a line ending with a newline, read from a file descriptor.

For more info about tast you can read Subject pdf.

Project is done in accordance with school Norme (you can see them in Norme pdf).

Good luck for everyone!
